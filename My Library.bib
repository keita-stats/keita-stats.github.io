It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The term compositional data analysis is historically associated to the approach based on the logratio transformations introduced in the eighties. Two main principles of this methodology are scale invariance and subcompositional coherence. New developments and concepts emerged in the last decade revealed the need to clarify the concepts of compositions, compositional sample space and subcomposition. In this work the mathematics of compositional analysis based on equivalence relation is presented. The two principles are essential attributes of the corresponding quotient space. A logarithmic isomorphism between quotient spaces induces a metric space structure for compositions. Using this structure, the statistical analysis of compositions consists of analysing logratio coordinates.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Interestingly, Bowker's statistic is a special case of the symmetry version of the Cressie--Read family of divergence statistics.

  abstract = {Sometimes, the same categorical variable is studied over different time periods or across different cohorts at the same time. One may consider, for example, a study of voting behaviour of different age groups across different elections, or the study of the same variable exposed to a child and a parent. For such studies, it is interesting to investigate how similar, or different, the variable is between the two time points or cohorts and so a study of the departure from symmetry of the variable is important. In this paper, we present a method of visualising any departures from symmetry using correspondence analysis. Typically, correspondence analysis uses Pearson's chi-squared statistic as the foundation for all of its numerical and visual features. In the case of studying the symmetry of a variable, Bowker's chi-squared statistic, presented in 1948, provides a simple numerical means of assessing symmetry. Therefore, this paper shall discuss how a correspondence analysis can be performed to study the symmetry (or lack thereof) of a categorical variable when Bowker's statistic is considered. The technique presented here provides an extension to the approach developed by Michael Greenacre in 2000.},

A median of 80 participants (10th--90th percentile 25--369) were recruited for parallel-group trials. 309 (60\%) were blinded. Power calculation, primary outcomes, random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and handling of attrition were each adequately described in less than half of publications.

  abstract = {In randomized trials, comparability of the treatment groups is ensured through allocation of treatments using a mechanism that involves some random element, thus controlling for confounding of the treatment effect. Completely random allocation ensures comparability between the treatment groups for all known and unknown prognostic factors. For a specific trial, however, imbalances in prognostic factors among the treatment groups may occur. Although accidental bias can be avoided in the presence of such imbalances by stratifying the analysis, most trialists, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders prefer a balanced distribution of prognostic factors across the treatment groups. Some procedures attempt to achieve balance in baseline covariates, by stratifying the allocation for these covariates, or by dynamically adapting the allocation using covariate information during the trial (covariate-adaptive procedures). In this Tutorial, the performance of minimization, a popular covariate-adaptive procedure, is compared with two other commonly used procedures, completely random allocation and stratified blocked designs. Using individual patient data of 2 clinical trials (in advanced ovarian cancer and age-related macular degeneration), the procedures are compared in terms of operating characteristics (using asymptotic and randomization tests), predictability of treatment allocation, and achieved balance. Fifty actual trials of various sizes that applied minimization for treatment allocation are used to investigate the achieved balance. Implementation issues of minimization are described. Minimization procedures are useful in all trials but especially when (1) many major prognostic factors are known, (2) many centers of different sizes accrue patients, or (3) the trial sample size is moderate.}

The total number of participants enrolled at the 16 clinical centers ranged from 133 to 559. The low yield of screenees to randomizations resulted from the study design, not from low levels of agreement to participate, and required the employment of a variety of recruitment strategies in a prudent overall plan. SHEP was one of the first clinical trials to use mass mailing as a primary strategy of recruitment. The study used mailing lists from seven generic sources. More than 3.4 million letters of invitation were mailed; they yielded an overall response rate of 4.3\%. Motor vehicle and voter registration lists provided the greatest numbers of names. Mailings to members of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and registrants of the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) provided the greatest response rates. Considerable variability in response rates existed among clinical centers using generically similar mailing lists. Generally, the number of hours spent on recruitment showed a positive, but not statistically significant, association with randomization yields. The recruitment yield was statistically significantly higher in clinics with experienced recruitment coordinators than in clinics with inexperienced ones (p = 0.0008). From these findings we conclude that mass mailing is an important strategy in an overall recruitment program, that the involvement of experienced recruitment staff is important, and that although the total time spent by staff on recruitment may also improve results, it matters less than the staff's level of recruiting experience.},

It was shown to be a non-linear operation in the simplex that does not preserve distances under perturbation. The discussion motivated the introduction in the present paper of concepts such as group of parts, balance between groups, and sequential binary partition, which are intended to provide tools of compositional data analysis for dimension reduction. Key concepts underlying this development are the established tools of subcomposition, coordinates in an orthogonal basis of the simplex, balancing element and, in general, the Aitchison geometry in the simplex. Main new results are: a method to analyze grouped parts of a compositional vector through the adequate coordinates in an ad hoc orthonormal basis; and the study of balances of groups of parts (inter-group analysis) as an orthogonal projection similar to that used in standard subcompositional analysis (intra-group analysis). A simulated example compares results when testing equal centers of two populations using amalgamated parts and balances; it shows that, in certain circumstances, results from both analysis can disagree.}

The sample space of these matrices is endowed with a group operation, the componentwise product or Hadamard product. Also an inner product, identified with the ordinary inner product of the componentwise logarithm of the matrices, completes the sample space to be a Euclidean space. This situation allows to introduce two orthogonal decompositions: the first one inspired on the independence of probability tables, and the second related to the reciprocal symmetry matrices whose transpose is the componentwise inverse. The combination of them results in an orthogonal decomposition into easily computable four parts. The merit of this decomposition is that, applied to exchange rate matrices, the four matrices of the decomposition admit an intuitive interpretation.},

The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.}

This leads to understanding why measures like covariance and correlation depend on the subcomposition considered, while measures like the distance between parts are independent of the same. It allows the definition of a novel index of proportionality between parts.\&lt;/p\&gt;}

Physician participation is vital to trial recruitment but is often limited.After 12 months of traditional recruitment to a clinical trial, we activated our electronic health record (EHR)--based clinical trial alert (CTA) system in selected outpatient clinics of a large, US academic health care system. When a patient's EHR data met selected trial criteria during the subsequent 4-month intervention period, the CTA prompted physician consideration of the patient's eligibility and facilitated secure messaging to the trial's coordinator. Subjects were the 114 physicians practicing at selected EHR-equipped clinics throughout our study. We compared differences in the number of physicians participating in recruitment and their recruitment rates before and after CTA activation.The CTA intervention was associated with significant increases in the number of physicians generating referrals (5 before and 42 after; P~\&lt;~.001) and enrollments (5 before and 11 after; P~=~.03), a 10-fold increase in those physicians' referral rate (5.7/mo before and 59.5/mo after; rate ratio, 10.44; 95\% confidence interval, 7.98-13.68; P\&lt;.001), and a doubling of their enrollment rate (2.9/mo before and 6.0/mo after; rate ratio, 2.06; 95\% confidence interval, 1.22-3.46; P~=~.007).Use of an EHR-based CTA led to significant increases in physicians' participation in and recruitment rates to an ongoing clinical trial.

This application regards relative count data, which are, e.g., obtained from sequencing experiments. First we review in some detail a variety of necessary concepts ranging from basic count distributions and their information-geometric description over the link between Bayesian statistics and shrinkage to the use of power transformations in CoDA. We then show that powering, i.e., the equivalent to scalar multiplication on the simplex, can be understood as a shrinkage problem on the tangent space of the simplex. In information-geometric terms, traditional shrinkage corresponds to an optimization along a mixture (or m-) geodesic, while powering (or, as we call it, exponential shrinkage) can be optimized along an exponential (or e-) geodesic. While the m-geodesic corresponds to the posterior mean of the multinomial counts using a conjugate prior, the e-geodesic corresponds to an alternative parametrization of the posterior where prior and data contributions are weighted by geometric rather than arithmetic means. To optimize the exponential shrinkage parameter, we use mean-squared error as a cost function on the tangent space. This is just the expected squared Aitchison distance from the true parameter. We derive an analytic solution for its minimum based on the delta method and test it via simulations. We also discuss exponential shrinkage as an alternative to zero imputation for dimension reduction and data normalization.}

Even though the case of vector or even two-factorial compositional data (compositional tables) is already well described in the literature, there is still a need for a comprehensive approach to the analysis of multi-factorial relative-valued data. Therefore, this contribution builds around the current knowledge about compositional data a general theoretical framework for k-factorial compositional data. As a main finding it turns out that, similar to the case of compositional tables, also the multi-factorial structures can be orthogonally decomposed into an independent and several interactive parts and, moreover, a coordinate representation allowing for their separate analysis by standard analytical methods can be constructed. For the sake of simplicity, these features are explained in detail for the case of three-factorial compositions (compositional cubes), followed by an outline covering the general case. The three-dimensional structure is analyzed in depth in two practical examples, dealing with systems of spatial and time dependent compositional cubes. The methodology is implemented in the R package robCompositions.}

Their cells, which generally contain positive real numbers rather than just counts, carry relative information about relationships between two factors. Hence, compositional tables can be seen as a generalization of (vector) compositional data. Due to their relative character, compositions are commonly expressed in orthonormal coordinates using a sequential binary partition prior to being further processed by standard statistical tools. Unfortunately, the resulting coordinates do not respect the two-dimensional nature of compositional tables. Information about relationship between factors is thus not well captured. The aim of this paper is to present a general system of orthonormal coordinates with respect to the Aitchison geometry, which allows for an analysis of the interactions between factors in a compositional table. This is achieved using logarithms of odds ratios, which are also widely used in the context of contingency tables.},

The models introduced in this paper are included within the general class of multiplicative models considered by Goodman (1972), but they are different from the specific kinds of models considered in that article.}

  abstract = {The approach to analysing compositional data has been dominated by the use of logratio transformations, to ensure exact subcompositional coherence and, in some situations, exact isometry as well. A problem with this approach is that data zeros, found in most applications, have to be replaced to allow the logarithmic transformation. An alternative new approach, called the `chiPower' transformation, which allows data zeros, is to combine the standardization inherent in the chi-square distance in correspondence analysis, with the essential elements of the Box-Cox power transformation. The chiPower transformation is justified because it defines between-sample distances that tend to logratio distances for strictly positive data as the power parameter tends to zero, and are then equivalent to transforming to logratios. For data with zeros, a value of the power can be identified that brings the chiPower transformation as close as possible to a logratio transformation, without having to substitute the zeros. Especially in the area of high-dimensional data, this alternative approach can present such a high level of coherence and isometry as to be a valid approach to the analysis of compositional data. Furthermore, in a supervised learning context, if the compositional variables serve as predictors of a response in a modelling framework, for example generalized linear models, then the power can be used as a tuning parameter in optimizing the accuracy of prediction through cross-validation. The chiPower-transformed variables have a straightforward interpretation, since they are identified with single compositional parts, not ratios.}

A simple modification of the centring of the matrix, coupled with the corresponding change in row and column masses and row and column metrics, allows the table to be decomposed into symmetric and skew symmetric components, which can then be analysed separately. The symmetric and skew symmetric analyses can be performed by using a simple correspondence analysis program if the data are set up in a special block format. The methodology is demonstrated on a social mobility table from the first democratically elected Parliament in Germany, the Frankfurter Nationalversammlung. The table cross-tabulates the jobs of parliamentarians when first entering the labour market and their jobs in May 1848 when the Parliament started its first session.},

  abstract = {Subcompositional coherence is a fundamental property of Aitchison's approach to compositional data analysis and is the principal justification for using ratios of components. We maintain, however, that lack of subcompositional coherence (i.e., incoherence) can be measured in an attempt to evaluate whether any given technique is close enough, for all practical purposes, to being subcompositionally coherent. This opens up the field to alternative methods that might be better suited to cope with problems such as data zeros and outliers while being only slightly incoherent. The measure that we propose is based on the distance measure between components. We show that the two-part subcompositions, which appear to be the most sensitive to subcompositional incoherence, can be used to establish a distance matrix that can be directly compared with the pairwise distances in the full composition. The closeness of these two matrices can be quantified using a stress measure that is common in multidimensional scaling, providing a measure of subcompositional incoherence. The approach is illustrated using power-transformed correspondence analysis, which has already been shown to converge to log-ratio analysis as the power transform tends to zero.}

  abstract = {Context The Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC) is the first clinical trials cooperative for palliative care in the U.S. Objectives To describe barriers and strategies for recruitment during the inaugural PCRC clinical trial. Methods The parent study was a multisite randomized controlled trial enrolling adults with life expectancy anticipated to be one to six months, randomized to discontinue statins (intervention) vs. to continue on statins (control). To study recruitment best practices, we conducted semistructured interviews with 18 site principal investigators (PIs) and clinical research coordinators (CRCs) and reviewed recruitment rates. Interviews covered three topics: 1) successful strategies for recruitment, 2) barriers to recruitment, and 3) optimal roles of the PI and CRC. Results All eligible site PIs and CRCs completed interviews and provided data on statin protocol recruitment. The parent study completed recruitment of 381 patients. Site enrollment ranged from 1 to 109 participants, with an average of 25 enrolled per site. Five major barriers included difficulty locating eligible patients, severity of illness, family and provider protectiveness, seeking patients in multiple settings, and lack of resources for recruitment activities. Five effective recruitment strategies included systematic screening of patient lists, thoughtful messaging to make research relevant, flexible protocols to accommodate patients' needs, support from clinical champions, and the additional resources of a trials cooperative group. Conclusion The recruitment experience from the multisite PCRC yields new insights into methods for effective recruitment to palliative care clinical trials. These results will inform training materials for the PCRC and may assist other investigators in the field.},

ACCORD is testing 3 complementary medical treatment strategies that may reduce high rates of major CVD morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD vanguard phase, conducted at 59 clinics in the United States and Canada, recruited 1,174 participants in 20 weeks from January through June 1, 2001, with a recruitment efficiency (R-factor) of 0.65. The recruitment strategies used in this vanguard phase were almost exclusively chart and database review within clinical practices and institutions. Recruitment for the main trial began in February 2003, involved 77 clinics, and resulted in an additional 9,077 participants by October 29, 2005 (total, 10,251). The R-factor during main trial recruitment was 0.96. Although new and refined recruitment strategies were formulated from the vanguard experience, the most powerful determinant of improved recruitment efficiency was the immediate start of enrollment by most clinics at the beginning of the main trial.

It extends and revises a similar review published in this journal a decade ago. The current commentary focuses on intervening developments in recruitment, including diverse populations, HIV trials, primary prevention trials, recruitment strategies, overall planning and management, patient and physician attitudes, adherence, generalizability, and cost. Profound barriers may exist in the recruitment of diverse populations, involving language, cultural factors, beliefs about medical research, and the appropriateness of available protocols. Extensive literature exists on patient and physician barriers to participation. Trials in HIV-infected or AIDs-diagnosed individuals introduce special considerations, including issues of confidentiality, parallel track design, and populations difficult to define and track. Recruitment strategies such as patient registries, occupational screening, direct mail, and the media are now prominent in the literature. Successful planning and management of an overall recruitment plan include piloting strategies, monitoring recruitment by data tracking systems, and hiring quality staff. Generalizability of study results is influenced by the characteristics of participants and by their adherence to study protocol. With increasingly limited funding to conduct clinical trials, efforts to quantify and reduce recruitment costs are being made. While over 4000 titles were identified, primarily by MEDLINE literature search, the articles summarized emphasize data-supported and- confirmed conclusions, and broad coverage of disease areas. We annotate here 91 outstanding articles useful for formulation of overall recruitment approaches in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Compositional count data are discrete vectors representing the numbers of outcomes falling into any of several mutually exclusive categories. Compositional techniques based on the log-ratio methodology are appropriate in those cases where the total sum of the vector elements is not of interest. Such compositional count data sets can contain zero values which are often the result of insufficiently large samples. That is, they refer to unobserved positive values that may have been observed with a larger number of trials or with a different sampling design. Because the log-ratio transformations require data with positive values, any statistical analysis of count compositions must be preceded by a proper replacement of the zeros. A Bayesian-multiplicative treatment has been proposed for addressing this count zero problem in several case studies. This treatment involves the Dirichlet prior distribution as the conjugate distribution of the multinomial distribution and a multiplicative modification of the non-zero values. Different parameterizations of the prior distribution provide different zero replacement results, whose coherence with the vector space structure of the simplex is stated. Their performance is evaluated from both the theoretical and the computational point of view.}

Special cases of the proposed model include conditional symmetry and symmetry. The relationship with marginal homogeneity is also described. The model for quasisymmetry is considered and is shown to be invariant under general permutation transformations of the indices, which makes it suitable for analysing data on a nominal scale. On the other hand, the new model, called p symmetry, is invariant only under the special reverse permutation transformation. This restricted invarianoe property makes the latter model more suitable for analysing data on an ordinal scale}

When the null hypothesis where the model is true is rejected, the interest turns to the degree to which the probability structure of the contingency table deviates from the model. Many indexes have been studied to measure the degree of the departure, such as the Yule coefficient and Cram{\'e}r coefficient for the independence model, and Tomizawa's symmetry index for the symmetry model. The inference of these indexes is performed using sample proportions, which are estimates of cell probabilities, but it is well known that the bias and mean square error (MSE) values become large without a sufficient number of samples. To address the problem, this study proposes a new estimator for indexes using Bayesian estimators of cell probabilities. Assuming the Dirichlet distribution for the prior of cell probabilities, we asymptotically evaluate the value of MSE, when plugging the posterior means of cell probabilities into the index, and propose an estimator of the index using the Dirichlet hyperparameter that minimizes the value. Numerical experiments show that when the number of samples per cell is small, the proposed method has smaller values of bias and MSE than other methods of correcting estimation accuracy. We also show that the values of bias and MSE are smaller than those obtained by using the uniform and Jeffreys priors.}

We view probability tables as elements of a simplex equipped with the Aitchison geometry. This perspective allows us to present a novel approach to analyzing symmetric structure using a compositionally coherent framework. We present a geometric interpretation of quasi-symmetry as an e-flat subspace and introduce a new concept called geometric marginal homogeneity, which is also characterized as an e-flat structure. We prove that both quasi-symmetric tables and geometric marginal homogeneous tables form subspaces in the simplex, and show that the measure of skew-symmetry in Aitchison geometry can be orthogonally decomposed into measures of departure from quasi-symmetry and geometric marginal homogeneity. We illustrate the application and effectiveness of our proposed methodology using data on unaided distance vision from a sample of women.}

The two groups were initially well matched in terms of physiological and neuropsychological function. Compliance with each oxygen regimen was good. Overall mortality in the nocturnal O2 therapy group was 1.94 times that in the continuous O2 therapy group (P = 0.01). This trend was striking in patients with carbon dioxide retention and also present in patients with relatively poor lung function, low mean nocturnal oxygen saturation, more severe brain dysfunction, and prominent mood disturbances. Continuous O2 therapy also appeared to benefit patients with low mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and those with relatively well-preserved exercise capacity. We conclude that in hypoxemic chronic obstructive lung disease, continuous O2 therapy is associated with a lower mortality than is nocturnal O2 therapy. The reason for this difference is not clear.}

Twenty-four hours of urokinase therapy resulted in greater improvement than streptokinase therapy; this was seen in scans, but not in angiograms. In massive embolism, this difference was statistically significant. Hemodynamic differences varied. There was no significant difference in mortality. Drug-related morbidity was minimal.

Using a geometric approach, we introduce the concept of metric variance and of a compositional unbiased estimator, and we show that the closed geometric mean is a c-BLU estimator (compositional best linear unbiased estimator with respect to the geometry of the simplex) of the center of the distribution of a random composition. Thus, it satisfies analogous properties to the arithmetic mean as a BLU estimator of the expected value in real space. The geometric approach used gives real meaning to the concepts of measure of central tendency and measure of dispersion and opens up a new way of understanding the statistical analysis of compositional data.}

Tools used in this case are reviewed and analysed, in particular the relationship between the positive orthant of D-dimensional real space, the product space of the real line times the D-part simplex, and their Euclidean space structures. The first alternative corresponds to data analysis taking logarithms on each component, and the second one to treat a log-transformed total jointly with a composition describing the distribution of component amounts. Real data about total abundances of phytoplankton in an Australian river motivated the present study and are used for illustration.}

  abstract = {`If the first button is buttoned wrongly, the whole vest sits askew'The main object of this paper is to propound and discuss a new indifference rule for the prior probabilities in the theory of inverse probability. Being invariant in form on transformation, this new rule avoids the mathematical inconsistencies associated with the classical rule of `uniform distribution of ignorance' and yields results which, particularly in certain critical extreme cases, do not appear to be unreasonable. Such a rule is, of course, a postulate and is not susceptible of proof; its object is to enable inverse probability to operate as a unified principle upon which methods may be devised of allowing a set of statistics to tell their complete and unbiased story about the parameters of the distribution law of the population from which they have been drawn, without the introduction of any knowledge beyond and extraneous to the statistics themselves. The forms appropriate for the prior probabilities in certain other circumstances are also discussed, including the important case where the unknown parameter is a probability, or proportion, for which it is desired to allow for prior bias. Before proceeding to the main purpose of the paper, however, it is convenient to provide some background to the subject. Reference is first made to certain modern writers to indicate how the problem with which inverse probability is concerned occupies a central place in the foundations of scientific method and in modern philosophy. In quoting from these writers I am not to be taken as suggesting that they necessarily support the inverse probability approach to the problem. The next section of the paper contains some brief comments on the direct statistical methods which have been devised in recent times to side-step induction and inverse probability, and this is followed by a few remarks on the various definitions of probability.}

Therefore, the method of sequential treatment assignment needs to be designed so that treatment balance is simultaneously achieved across all such patient factors. Traditional methods of restricted randomization such as "permuted blocks within strata" prove inadequate once the number of strata, or combinations of factor levels, approaches the sample size. A new general procedure for treatment assignment is described which concentrates on minimizing imbalance in the distributions of treatment numbers within the levels of each individual prognostic factor. The improved treatment balance obtained by this approach is explored using simulation for a simple model of a clinical trial. Further discussion centers on the selection, predictability and practicability of such a procedure.]}

This chapter reviews more recent covariate-adaptive randomization procedures. It first describes methods to balance within strata, marginally, and overall for a set of discrete strata. The chapter then describes methods that treat covariates as continuous. The covariate-adaptive randomization procedures are arbitrary in the sense that they are developed intuitively rather than based on some optimal criterion. The chapter also describes techniques to analyze data following covariate-adaptive randomization. It explains model-based inference and randomization-based inference. In conclusion, valid inference under a population model can only be attained under covariate-adaptive randomization if a covariate-adjusted analysis is used, adjusting for the variables used for the randomization and the model is correctly specified. Usual population-based inference methods valid under fixed, complete, or restricted randomization will be conservative otherwise.},

We show that the approximate rate of convergence of the Gibbs sampler by Gaussian approximation is equal to that of the corresponding EM-type algorithm. This helps in implementing either of the algorithms as improvement strategies for one algorithm can be directly transported to the other. In particular, by running the EM algorithm we know approximately how many iterations are needed for convergence of the Gibbs sampler. We also obtain a result that under certain conditions, the EM algorithm used for finding the maximum likelihood estimates can be slower to converge than the corresponding Gibbs sampler for Bayesian inference. We illustrate our results in a number of realistic examples all based on the generalized linear mixed models.}

Four-hundred and ninety-two TOMBOLA participants (response rate 56\%) completed questionnaires on reasons for participation. One-hundred and thiry-seven women (38\%) who declined TOMBOLA participation completed questionnaires on reasons for this.Results Eighty percent of women reported that one of their reasons for attending their TOMBOLA recruitment appointment was worries about their smear result. Ninety-four percent participated in the RCT because it was a worthwhile contribution to the cervical screening programme and other women; for 70\% this was the most important reason. These proportions did not vary by socio-demographic factors. Thirty-two percent thought participation would result in better care. The most common reason for non-participation was preference for follow-up from the woman's GP. Logistical issues (eg, inconvenient appointments, travel time, arranging time off work or child-care) were commonly cited. Fourteen percent were too frightened to participate; this was unrelated to the grade of the recruitment smear. Limitations Response rates were not high, but there was little evidence of response bias. Structured questionnaires were used.Conclusions Future research should address how best to deliver information to ensure different social groups appreciate potential benefits of RCT participation and provide reassurance regarding fears about participation. Simple strategies (eg, appealing to the altruism of potential participants or offering flexible recruitment clinic locations and times) might enhance RCT recruitment rates. This in turn would ensure best use of research resources thus bringing the greatest benefits to participants and the population.}

Caussinus proposed a quasi-symmetry model which served as a bridge between symmetry and marginal homogeneity in square contingency tables. This study significantly influenced methodological developments in the statistical analysis of categorical data. Herein recent advances in quasi-symmetry are reviewed with an emphasis on four topics related to the author's results: (1) modeling based on the f-divergence, (2) the necessary and sufficient condition of symmetry, (3) partition of test statistics for symmetry, and (4) measure of the departure from symmetry. The asymmetry model based on f-divergence enables us to express various asymmetries. Additionally, these models are useful to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions of symmetry with desirable properties. This review may be useful to consider the statistical modeling and the measure of symmetry for contingency tables with the same classifications.},

Testing the method by computer simulations, using data on 40 patients with 15 variates each, demonstrates a four- to fivefold reduction of the probability of severe imbalance, relative to randomization. Minimization can maintain tight control of one variate, comparable to the currently acceptable experimental design of blocking, while reduCing the probability of severe imbalance in the other 14 variates by a factor of 3. It also compares favorably with accepted methods regarding susceptibility to experimenter bias. Therefore, it is suggested that minimization should replace randomization in assigning patients in clinical trials.}

Obtained results form a discrete approximation to this ccdf, and its corresponding discrete probability density function (cpdf) should be a vector, where each component gives the probability of an occurrence of a class. Therefore, this vector must have positive components summing up to one, like in a composition in the simplex. This suggests a simplicial approach to IK, based on the algebraic-geometric structure of this sample space: simplicial IK actually works with log-odds. Interpolated log-odds can afterwards be easily re-expressed as the desired cpdf or ccdf. An alternative but equivalent approach may also be based on log-likelihoods. Both versions of the method avoid by construction all conventional IK standard drawbacks: estimates are always within the (0,1) interval and present no order-relation problems (either with kriging or co-kriging). Even the modeling of indicator structural functions is clarified.}

  abstract = {In clinical trials, sample size re-estimation is often conducted at interim. The purpose is to determine whether the study will achieve study objectives if the observed treatment effect at interim preserves till end of the study. A traditional approach is to conduct a conditional power analysis for sample size only based on observed treatment effect. This approach, however, does not take into consideration the variabilities of (i) the observed (estimate) treatment effect and (ii) the observed (estimate) variability associated with the treatment effect. Thus, the resultant re-estimated sample sizes may not be robust and hence may not be reliable. In this article, a couple of methods are proposed, namely, adjusted effect size (AES) approach and iterated expectation/variance (IEV) approach, which can account for the variability associated with the observed responses at interim. The proposed methods provide interval estimates of sample size required for the intended trial, which is useful for making critical go/no go decision. Statistical properties of the proposed methods are evaluated in terms of controlling of type I error rate and statistical power. The results show that traditional approach performs poorly in controlling type I error inflation, whereas IEV approach has the best performance in most cases. Additionally, all re-estimation approaches can keep the statistical power over 80\%; especially, IEV approach's statistical power, using adjusted significance level, is over 95\%. However, IEV approach may lead to a greater increment in sample size when detecting a smaller effect size. In general, IEV approach is effective when effect size is large; otherwise, AES approach is more suitable for controlling type I error rate and keep power over 80\% with a more reasonable re-estimated sample size.},

However, the lack of seamless integration between clinical research and patient care workflow impedes recruitment efficiency, escalates research costs, and hence threatens the entire clinical research enterprise. Increased use of electronic health records (EHRs) holds promise for facilitating this integration but must surmount regulatory obstacles. Among the unintended consequences of current research oversight are barriers to accessing patient information for prescreening and recruitment, coordinating scheduling of clinical and research visits, and reconciling information about clinical and research drugs. We conclude that the EHR alone cannot overcome barriers in conducting clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research. Patient privacy and human subject protection policies should be clarified at the local level to exploit optimally the full potential of EHRs, while continuing to ensure participant safety. Increased alignment of policies that regulate the clinical and research use of EHRs could help fulfill the vision of more efficiently obtaining clinical research evidence to improve human health.}

  abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND The multiple determinants of a patient's decision to enter into a clinical trial have been explored largely from the perspectives of patients and their physicians. Little research has involved clinical research associates (CRAs) formally, despite their central role in the process of recruitment. The current study was initiated to explore the factors that influence the decision of patients with cancer regarding clinical trial entry, specifically from the perspective of the CRA. METHODS Two focus groups of CRAs from the Hamilton Regional Cancer Center were organized. A skilled facilitator guided both groups through exploratory and subsequent confirmatory phases of discussions, which were audiotaped for review and coding using a process of consensus employing intercoder triangulation. RESULTS The two groups identified a number of factors that they believed influenced the recruitment process. Numerous physician and patient factors were reaffirmed, such as the impression of the scientific merit of a study or the sense of personal benefit, respectively. More uniquely, CRAs identified information transfer within the informed consent process as a major aspect of their specialized role. It was believed that full disclosure of information, in terms of both the content and the techniques and styles of delivery, was an important predictor of recruitment success. The groups quickly reached consensus on which factors they believed were the most important overall with respect to influencing study recruitment. CONCLUSIONS CRAs appear to have a unique role in the process of recruiting patients to active clinical trials. They believe that they have an important influence on recruitment success. Further research to validate this impression is required, because, ultimately, a greater understanding of the relative roles of physician and patient factors and, potentially, CRA factors will be important in the development of ethical and supportive strategies to optimize the recruitment of patients with cancer into randomized clinical trials.
